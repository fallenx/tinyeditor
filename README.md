# tinyeditor
Tiny but fast Text Editor

This software aims faster code experience & tiny memory foot print

It uses SDL2.0 media library, and tinyfilediaolgs file_dialog manager and works on windows for now...

It can also open text files up to (the memory you can provide) and edits it blazingly fast.

It has all basic commands such as (as you also know) Caret Movement, Page_Up, Page_Down, Copy, Paste, Cut and Insert

Theoratically infinite numbers of Undo/Redo (That's not tested) and should also be reviewed and be updated


Author Notes
-----------------

For now software is in primitive (alpha) state if I may call it that way
There are lots of work to do...
The code as you see it, is a mess, I try to C++ing it...

Any comments and help will be welcomed...
